# Screenshot capture notes

The README screenshots show the real React renderer and local server running
with isolated sample data from [scripts/preview.ts](../../scripts/preview.ts).
No real credentials or provider accounts were used.

- `subscriptions.png`: account pools, remaining quotas, and reset times.
- `activity.png`: seven days of sample request history and token usage.
- `connect.png`: Codex configuration completed in an isolated agent home, with
  the launch command displayed. Codex was not launched.

Captured September 14, 2026 at 2880 × 1620 from source
`bbc1e0ca4e82f083795b2cd110a8033ef1e204df`. The source build passed before capture.
An ignored preview copy used ports 4521/4522 and distinct sample model IDs for
Claude and Codex to demonstrate provider selection.

These are browser preview captures, not native Electron window captures. Live
inference, quota retrieval, reset redemption, and menu-bar behavior are outside
their scope.

To refresh them, run `bun run preview`, open the printed local session link in
an isolated browser, and capture each view at a 1440 × 810 viewport with 2× scale.
